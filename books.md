Samara Linton is the editor of *The Colour of Madness*, a patchwork anthology which provides a platform for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) experiences of mental health in the UK. The anthology serves to address the disparity between the mental health services provided to the BAME community and those offered to less marginalised groups.
