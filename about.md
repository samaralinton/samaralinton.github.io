She was awarded Best New Journalist at the Ending Violence Against Women Media Awards 2016 for her work on black women’s mental health and the detention of undocumented migrants in the UK.

March 2016 saw the Parliamentary launch of Lessons from Ebola Affected Communities: being prepared for future health crises, [a report](http://www.royalafricansociety.org/appg-reports) she co-edited for the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group. The report was described as “open and honest” by Lord Chidgey, and then DFID Minister, Nick Hurd, said the report was “extremely useful and well-written.” Samara was also the president of the London branch of [Polygeia](http://www.polygeia.com/), an organisation which empowers students to research and write policy on global health issues.
