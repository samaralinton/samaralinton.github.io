<blockquote>They see my hair and call me brave<br />
What a world we live in<br />
Where it is brave to love your face<br />
To love your natural beauty<br />
To cut and press and weave and plait<br />
To look in the mirror and always see<br />
The majestic woman<br />
You were born to be</p>
<p>- Samara Linton</p></blockquote>
