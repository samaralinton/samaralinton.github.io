<p>Violence against women can be defined as “violence that is directed at a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately”. Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary General, states that “violence against women continues to persist as one of the most heinous, systematic and prevalent human rights abuses in the world. It is a threat to all women, and an obstacle to all our efforts for development, peace, and gender equality in all societies”.</p>
