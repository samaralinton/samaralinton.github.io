<p><strong>Podcast Summary </strong></p>
<p>Mental health is an area which many find difficult to speak about. We live in a society where it’s more acceptable to suffer in in silence than to equip ourselves with the knowledge to have healthy minds. We believe it’s time to change that, which is why we created the Be Well Campaign.</p>
<p>On the September 27th we will be hosting our first live online panel discussion. Members of the panel will be made of young professionals, each having an intimate relationship with the subject of mental health through working in the space or living with own mental health battles while still finding career success. This will be a chance to hear them speak about their experiences in a transparent and vulnerable manner like you may have never heard before.</p>
<p>The live discussion will give you the opportunity to interact with the conversation, giving your own point of views, sharing your experiences as well as asking the questions that are important to you. It will also provide the opportunity to interact and join the Dream Nation community, giving you a safe space to speak and learn about difficult and sensitive issues.</p>
<p>We are an open community and network of Practical Dreamers, women and men who are working together to turn our individual goals and dreams into our realities. We believe the Be Well campaign is so important because often due to the size and difficulties of our dreams, we are often under an enormous amount of stress. Therefore understanding and learning how to develop positive mental health habits is an extremely important step and tool for all Practical Dreamers.</p>
